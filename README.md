Breast Cancer Detection:
Given the parameters like 
-'clump_thickness'
-'uniform_cell_size'
-'uniform_cell_shape'
-'marginal_adhesion',
-'single_epithelial_size'
-'bare_nuclei'
-'bland-chromatin'
-'normal_nucleoli'
-'mitosis'
we have to classify weather tumar is malignant or benign.

I have used KNN and SVM to classify.
